            <h3>Theme</h3>
            This year, our theme is <strong>Intent, Design, Solutions: Contexts in Engineering Education</strong>. We invite colleagues (faculty,
            researchers, graduate students, post-docs, and undergraduates) to join us in sharing their work and ideas about how
            contexts (or the lack of them) impact all aspects of engineering education.

            <h3>Invited Speakers</h3>

            <p>
                <strong>Keynote speaker: Vincent Brannigan</strong>, J.D. and Professor Emeritus at the University of Maryland, will speak to us about the ways in which engineering work must
                be contextualized in order to function properly. He brings his wealth of knowledge to bear, exploring memorable cases when the lack of holistic engineering contexts
                have produced failures that were avoidable. His primary research and teaching areas are product liability and government regulation of technology, with a special
                emphasis on the problem of dealing with novel technologies.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Banquet Speakers:</strong> Students and instructors will share their ongoing situated engineering work that has begun a fish farm + aquaponics project for an orphanage in
                Chile. The goal is to provide a source of steady and predictable income for the orphanage. Created as the cornerstone for an Engineering Entrepreneurship course at
                Cornell University, instructors and students will share their amazing engineering work and outcomes with banquet attendees.
